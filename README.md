# Restaurant Delivery Route Optimization
### Overview
This project implements the Ant Colony Algorithm and the Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the delivery route of a restaurant. The code downloads the graph map of the city of Santos, Brazil using the osmnx library, and then applies the algorithm to find the best route for delivering multiple orders.

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* networkx
* osmnx
* folium
* requests
* json

### Usage
1. Clone the .jupyter file. 
2. Run the cells to execute the code.
3. The code will output the optimized delivery route on the map.
4. Simply change the location, if you want to.
